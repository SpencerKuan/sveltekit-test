        I had a simple wordpress website before this; I'm trying to redesign my website from scratch. Thus, this website might not be visually stunning, or even completely functional, but I can say that I created it myself, which I consider to be an accomplishment.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm still deciding what content I want to include on this site. However, I believe I will probably at least attempt to include some of my programs, projects, and a few computer-graphics tutorials. I may also include my resume when I make it, but that's another project.
    </p>

    <p>
        For now, this website will serve as an ongoing effort aid my web development skills. Many of the programs that were featured on my previous website will be added (probably) here eventually.
